We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of creating a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

## Instructions

####
Make sure you have followed the instructions in the [classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209-beta/parts/4405411f-bdc8-43fb-9e2b-b4b98a61c760/modules/375d6b1e-b31a-4d2e-b33a-996167faf77e/lessons/a4a80417-00cb-4a9c-8cc4-3a091414baa2/concepts/b4b04f6b-ed58-483b-acc7-3e5628ed9478) to setup your environment. You can also utilize the AWS GPU instances for this lab, although you can manage quite well with just a CPU. The instructions for AWS can be found [here].

#### Run the Notebook
Run the following commands from the same directory as the commands above.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-CNN-Lab.git
$ activate RoboND
$ jupyter notebook
```
The above will open the jupyter interface in your browser from where you can access the Lab folder and the jupyter notebook `CNN_lab.ipynb`

This is a self-assessed lab. Feel free to compare your results and discuss on improvements with your fellow students in the Slack!
